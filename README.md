# Earthquake
## Abstract
This project explores the factors influencing the significance and impact of earthquakes using a dataset of 782 recorded events from 2001 to 2023. The analysis incorporates statistical techniques, including Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) tests to assess multicollinearity, and predictive modeling using the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm. Key visualizations, created with Power BI, highlight patterns and relationships between earthquake magnitude, depth, and other covariates. Additionally, a two-sample t-test was conducted to evaluate the effect of tsunami occurrences as a categorical variable. The study provides insights into earthquake risk assessment and supports predictive modeling for actuarial and disaster management applications.
